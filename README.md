# Snake Game - Matrix Logic & Event Handling
Matrix State Management: The game board is modeled as a NumPy array matrix. All logic for snake growth, movement, and collision detection is handled through vector indexing and matrix operations, ensuring high performance.
Event-Driven Architecture: Built using PyQt5, the system utilizes a custom Game Loop managed via QTimers. This ensures smooth real-time control and precise handling of keyboard interrupts.
Coordinate Mapping Algorithm: Implementation of a 2D-to-Linear transformation algorithm to map internal matrix indices to the graphical user interface (GUI) pixels.
